### Subject: WE NEED A NEW DOCUMENTARY ABOUT SHARKS ASAP

Hi Team A,

We need to QUICKLY identify the best locations for our next “shark attacks” documentary. Our market research team identifies this as the new topic that everyone will be interested in. A very nice dataset will be provided for your work.

I hope you come up with some good ideas for us. Please provide your insights with supporting data by the end of the week.

Don’t let me down, the future of this company relies on you,

The CEO, Netflix
